# Reusing UI components

Guillermo De Fermin

---

## Why resuable UI components?

- Reusing is good! ‚ôªÔ∏è
- Consistency across different applications
- Decouples component development from app development

<img src={pic} />

import pic2 from './images/inconsistent-design-2.jpg';

<img src={pic2} />

---

## Isolated component development

- Components are created and reviewed out of context, making it easier to keep them generic
- Components are tested independently of applications
- Most components are already available when developing a new feature

## Our implementation: [@taxfix/ui](https://github.com/taxfix/ui-framework)

- Based on [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- Themes for internal products and external products
- A few custom components
- Currently used in [Taxmin](https://integration-taxmin.taxfix.de)
- Check out our [docs](https://ui.taxfix.de)!

## Why use an existing framework?

- We don't need to reimplement most simple components, we get tested and tried primitives for free
- We don't need to think about component classification, theme structure, component names, ...
- We get generic components with great APIs and customization options for edge cases
